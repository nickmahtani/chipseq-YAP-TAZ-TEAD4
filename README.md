# ChIP-seq Analysis of YAP/TAZ/TEAD4 Co-binding

Reproducing Figure 1 from [Zanconato et al. 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6186417/) using ChIP-seq data for the Hippo pathway effectors YAP, TAZ, and TEAD4. Based on Tommy Tang's [ChIP-seq tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@crazyhottommy).

## Results

**YAP/TAZ and TEAD4 peak overlap** — 5,965 shared binding sites:

**TEAD4 summit distance relative to TAZ peaks** — sharp enrichment at 0 bp confirms co-localization:

## Pipeline

**Upstream (bash):**
FASTQ → Bowtie2 alignment → BAM sorting/indexing → BigWig generation → MACS2 peak calling → bedtools multicov

**Downstream (R):**
- Venn diagrams of YAP/TAZ and YAP-TAZ/TEAD4 peak overlaps (`fig1_a_b_c.R`)
- TEAD4 summit distance relative to TAZ peaks — peak density plot
- Common peak identification and read count quantification (`fig 1 def.R`)
